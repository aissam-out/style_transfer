# style_transfer

In this project, we will apply neural style transfer to extract the style from one image and use it to decorate another one. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to generate beautiful works of art with neural style transfer.

To do so we used the pretrained CNN VGG19 and the open source Machine Learning library PyTorch.
